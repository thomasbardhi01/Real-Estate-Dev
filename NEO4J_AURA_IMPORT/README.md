## 🚀 How to Import to Neo4j Aura

### Step 1: Upload CSV Files
1. Go to your Neo4j Aura database
2. Click "Import" 
3. **Drag and drop** these 3 files:
   - `owners.csv`
   - `properties.csv` 
   - `ownership_relationships.csv`

### Step 2: Run Import Script
1. Open Neo4j Browser in your Aura database
2. Copy and paste the contents of `aura_import_script.cypher`
3. Run the script (it will run in sections automatically)
4. Wait for import to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Import
The script includes validation queries that will show:
- Total counts of owners, properties, relationships
- Joint ownership examples
- Sample queries to test functionality

## 🎯 What You Can Query After Import

### Who owns this property?
```cypher
MATCH (p:Property {address: "123 MAIN ST"})<-[r:OWNS]-(o:Owner)
RETURN o.name, r.ownershipPercentage, r.ownershipType;
```

### What properties does this person own?
```cypher
MATCH (o:Owner {name: "SMITH JOHN"})-[r:OWNS]->(p:Property)
RETURN p.address, r.ownershipPercentage;
```

### Properties with multiple owners?
```cypher
MATCH (p:Property)<-[r:OWNS]-(o:Owner)
WITH p, count(o) as owner_count
WHERE owner_count > 1
RETURN p.address, owner_count
ORDER BY owner_count DESC;
```

### LLC portfolios?
```cypher
MATCH (o:Owner)-[r:OWNS]->(p:Property)
WHERE o.name ENDS WITH ' LLC'
RETURN o.name, count(p) as properties, sum(p.currentAssessedValue) as total_value
ORDER BY properties DESC;
```
